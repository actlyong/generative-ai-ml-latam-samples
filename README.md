# Generative AI/ML LATAM Samples

This repo provides Generative AI and AI/ML code samples, blueprints (end-to-end solutions) and proof of concepts oriented to the LATAM market

## Getting started

This repo is organized as follows:

* **samples**: Code samples/notebooks that demonstrate a specific AI/ML functionality in AWS
* **blueprints**: End-to-end solutions for a specific use case. 
  * They include [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates to provision the solution to your account. 
  * They may include a demo UI.
* **proof-of-concepts**: Code samples/notebooks that aim to prove a concept in AI/ML e.g.
  * research paper techniques implementations
  * novel tecniques implementations
